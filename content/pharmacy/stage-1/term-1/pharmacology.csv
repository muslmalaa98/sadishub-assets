"After IV infusion, the time to reach ~95% of steady-state concentration is approximately:","1 half-life","2 half-lives","4.32 half-lives","10 half-lives",C,"~95% is reached at about 4.32 t1/2.","pharma"
"After IV infusion, the time to reach ~99% of steady-state concentration is approximately:","3.32 half-lives","4.32 half-lives","6.65 half-lives","1.5 half-lives",C,"~99% is reached at about 6.65 t1/2.","pharma"
"Increasing the infusion rate will:","Shorten time to steady state","Not change time to steady state","Delay time to steady state","Stop elimination",B,"Time to steady state depends on elimination half-life, not infusion rate.","pharma"
"At steady state during constant IV infusion, the rate of infusion equals:","Rate of distribution","Rate of absorption","Rate of elimination","Zero",C,"At steady state, rate in = rate out and dC/dt = 0.","pharma"
"The steady-state concentration (Css) for constant IV infusion is proportional to:","Infusion rate (R)","Elimination rate constant only (k)","Volume of distribution only (Vd)","Dose interval (τ)",A,"Css depends on R (and also on Vd and k/Cl).","pharma"
"Which equation best represents Css during constant IV infusion (one-compartment)?","Css = R/(Vd·k)","Css = (Vd·k)/R","Css = R·Vd·k","Css = R/k",A,"Css = R/(Vd·k) for a one-compartment model.","pharma"
"Total body clearance (Cl) can be obtained from infusion if R and Css are known by:","Cl = Css/R","Cl = R/Css","Cl = R·Css","Cl = Vd/k",B,"At steady state in infusion: Cl = R/Css.","pharma"
"A loading dose is primarily used to:","Decrease clearance","Obtain desired concentration rapidly","Increase half-life","Reduce bioavailability",B,"Loading dose speeds attainment of target concentrations.","pharma"
"In a one-compartment model, giving a loading dose equal to R/k followed by infusion will:","Delay steady state","Achieve steady state immediately","Cause zero plasma concentration","Prevent elimination",B,"DL = R/k gives immediate steady state when followed by infusion.","pharma"
"If the loading dose is larger than R/k, plasma concentration will:","Instantly stay at Css forever","Decline to Css","Rise slowly to Css","Become zero quickly",B,"Too large DL leads to higher initial level then declines to Css.","pharma"
"If the loading dose is lower than R/k, plasma concentration will:","Rise to Css (faster than no loading dose)","Immediately reach Css","Never reach Css","Jump above toxic level always",A,"Too small DL means concentration builds up to Css.","pharma"
"The goal of multiple-dosage regimens is to keep plasma levels within:","MTC only","Therapeutic window (between MEC and MTC)","Below MEC","Always above MTC",B,"Aim is levels above MEC and below MTC.","pharma"
"Two main adjustable parameters in designing a dosage regimen are:","Clearance and Vd","Dose size and dosing interval","Half-life and AUC","Bioavailability and pH",B,"You can adjust dose amount and frequency (interval).","pharma"
"The principle of superposition assumes that early doses:","Alter absorption of later doses","Do not affect pharmacokinetics of later doses","Stop elimination","Cause nonlinear kinetics",B,"Superposition assumes PK unchanged and linearity holds.","pharma"
"Superposition generally does NOT apply when:","Drug shows nonlinear pharmacokinetics","Drug is first-order and linear","Dose interval is constant","Bioavailability is 100%",A,"Nonlinear PK makes predictions unreliable.","pharma"
"Which factor can break superposition and change PK after multiple dosing?","Enzyme induction/inhibition","Constant dosing interval only","Stable physiology always","None of the above",A,"Induction/inhibition or changing physiology may alter PK.","pharma"
"Drug accumulation occurs when the next dose is given:","After complete elimination of previous dose","Before previous dose is fully eliminated","Only with IV infusion","Only if dose is tiny",B,"Shorter interval than elimination time causes accumulation.","pharma"
"At steady state with repetitive dosing, plasma levels fluctuate between:","Css and zero","C∞max and C∞min","MEC and zero only","Ka and k",B,"At steady state, levels fluctuate between C∞max and C∞min.","pharma"
"At steady state, C∞max and C∞min are:","Changing every dose","Constant from dose to dose","Always equal","Always zero",B,"Once steady state occurs, peaks/troughs repeat consistently.","pharma"
"C∞max is especially important for:","Drug taste","Safety (should be below MTC)","Tablet color","Absorption rate only",B,"Peak should stay below the minimum toxic concentration.","pharma"
"Drug accumulation index depends on:","Dose size only","k and dosing interval (τ)","Dose color","Vd only",B,"Accumulation depends on elimination and τ, not the dose amount.","pharma"
"Time to reach steady state in repetitive dosing is mainly dependent on:","Dose size","Dosing interval only","Elimination half-life","Bioavailability only",C,"Time to steady state depends mainly on elimination half-life.","pharma"
"Accumulation half-life for IV administration is:","Equal to elimination half-life","Half of elimination half-life","Independent of elimination half-life","Equal to dosing interval",A,"For IV, accumulation t1/2 equals elimination t1/2.","pharma"
"Clinically, time to reach ~90% of steady state is about:","1.1 half-lives","2 half-lives","3.3 half-lives","9 half-lives",C,"~90% is about 3.3 half-lives.","pharma"
"Clinically, time to reach ~99% of steady state is about:","6.6 half-lives","3.3 half-lives","1 half-life","0.5 half-life",A,"~99% is about 6.6 half-lives.","pharma"
"Average steady-state concentration (C∞av) equals:","(C∞max + C∞min)/2 always","AUC over dosing interval divided by τ","C∞max only","C∞min only",B,"C∞av = AUC(τ)/τ at steady state.","pharma"
"C∞av is NOT the arithmetic mean of C∞max and C∞min because:","Concentration declines exponentially","Drug tastes bitter","Vd is constant","k equals 0",A,"Exponential decline means average isn’t simple mean.","pharma"
"A loading dose to achieve target concentration quickly can be calculated using:","DL = Css·Vd","DL = Css/k","DL = Vd/k","DL = Css·τ",A,"Common method: DL = target concentration × Vd.","pharma"
"Dose ratio is defined as:","Maintenance/Loading","Loading dose / Maintenance dose","Cmax/Cmin","AUC/τ",B,"Dose ratio = DL divided by maintenance dose.","pharma"
"As a general rule, the dose ratio (DL/maintenance) is approximately:","0.5","1.0","2.0","10",C,"A common rule-of-thumb is about 2.0.","pharma"
"For IV injection, the fraction absorbed (F) is:","0","0.5","1.0","Depends on food",C,"For IV, F = 1.0.","pharma"
